## Section 1 Reflection

1. > How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

  * [Broken link. Hold up on this per Eric in Slack.]

2. > What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

  * command - what you enter into the Terminal to do things
  * directory - a folder on your computer, Github, etc
  * code comments - comments you put in code that get ignored by Javascript (helpful for yourself & others to hide things or document purposes)
  * String - data type - characters in a word/phrase
  * Number - data type - floats (decimal numbers) or integers (whole numbers)
  * Boolean - data type - true/false
  * variable - store a value under the with a data type
  * assignment operator - =, +, etc
  * re-assignment (of a variable) - set it as something else (leave out the "var" in the cmd)
  * concatenation - joining strings together with console.log("this shows me " + var1 + " and " + var2)
  *  `console.log()` - computer print back text to you
  *  `var` - variable
  *  `true` - true Boolean
  *  `false` - false Boolean

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

  * ``console.log("Hello World!");``

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

  * ``//``
  * You put in code that get ignored by Javascript (helpful for yourself & others to hide things or document purposes).

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

  * container for a value
  * "It's a category, like 'colors' or 'animals'."

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

  * ``var darkMode = false``
  * ``var mobileSite = true``
  * ``var iPAddress = 168.212.226.204``

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

  * joining strings together with console.log("this shows me " + var1 + " and " + var2)

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

  * ``console.log("You have played " + numberOfGames + " games of chess. You have won " + numbersOfWins + " games and lost " + numberOfLosses + " games.")``

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

  * In the very top sections of the exercises documents, where it lists a command to run the code to print in the terminal, how do I do that? It's not working, but I'm going to keep trying to figure it out.

    (Edit: Resolved!)

  * What's a "modulo"? The answers on Google are confusing me, but I'm also going to keep trying to figure it out.
