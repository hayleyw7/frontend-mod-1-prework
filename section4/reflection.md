## Section 4 Reflection

1. > How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

    * I don't have time for as many breaks as pom asked for. I tried to do it, but I just have too much to do in the time period available. I tried to do half as many breaks of twice as long so that I could consume tobacco. That does help me a lot more.

1. > Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

    * I tried it, but I needed more time than 25 minutes to get everything done in time. I focus less than usual when I take these times, because I have to start over from scratch to get my mind back into it. However, I have an idea of why this is tougher for me than some. It's that I have ADHD-I. I'm definitely more distracted when I do the pom technique, and it makes me lose a ton of time, way more than I'd think.

1. > What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

    * Objects are properties, which are things with characteristics, while arrays are just a list of data in a variable.

1. > For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * > List of all of the students in class
      * array
  * > List of states and their capitals
      * object
  * > List of things to pack for vacation
      * array
  * > Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
      * array
  * > List of student names and their cohort
      * object
  * > Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
      * array
  * > All my favorite restaurants
      * array

1. > In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

    * It could be a Reddit comment.
    * ```
    var comment12846482 = {
      user: "sharon54",
      time: "11:54 AM",
      url: "www.reddit.om/r/sub/comments/bufoqweo8733"
    };
    ```

1. > What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

    * I have so many questions. I'm actually also going to ask a friend to help me with these. As with Section 3, I understand the big picture, but figuring out the code is a little tough.

    * Edit: Resolved!
