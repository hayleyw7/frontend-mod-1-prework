## Section 3 Reflection

1. > What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

    * "By practicing setting S.M.A.R.T. goals Setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound goals helps you to approach learning to code with clarity, focus, and use of appropriate strategies." This is very useful and I will keep this acronym in mind.
    * "By striving to improve within one’s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) Problem solving takes place within reach of one’s capabilities with some help or guidance." This reminds me that I need to ask for more help when I need it.

1. >In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

    * I'm always willing to learn and take in new information. However, I need to ask for help more. That I mentioned above. I'm working on it, but it's tough to find the balance.

1. >Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

    * var moods = ["Good", "Neutral", "Bad"]. These are moods you can pick that you feel each day from Daylio.
    * var hobbies = ["ski", "clean", "doctor"]. These are hobbies you can pick that you do each day from Daylio.
    * var accomplishments = ["threeDayGoodStreak", "tenDayGoodStreak", "fiftyDayGoodStreak"]. These are accomplishments you can get for having "Good" days in Daylio.

1. > In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

    * An array is a variable that you choose values for in a list of strings, numbers, etc.

1. > What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

    * A loop is used to complete the same task more than once to save time and code length.
    * You'd use it only if you have to do things more than once. Otherwise, it's excess code for no reason.

1. > If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

    * "Want to do the same thing again and again? You don't have to remember what to do every time, or even do it every time! You just set it up to go again and again if you want! It's easy!"

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

    * I'm having issues with the .js files on a lot of issues. I'm going to reach out for help today and see how that goes. I hope some things click! I understand the big pictures, but I need some help putting the code together.

come back to this!!!!!!!
