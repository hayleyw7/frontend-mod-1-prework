## Section 2 Reflection

1. > Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

     * I wait too long, and I need to work on that.

1. > In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

     * It felt frustrating.
     * I had to spend a lot of time and couldn't always figure it out on my own.
     * I had issues and needed to ask for help (after using a lot of Google). Learning how to Google better is always a good way to improve, and I need to ask for help quicker and more often, so that was a good habit to develop.

1. > What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

     * conditional - statement that determines whether pieces of code can run (ex: if statement)
     * ```var pollen = "low"
       if (pollen == 'high') {
       console.log('High Pollen');
     } else if (pollen == 'low') {
       console.log('Low Pollen');
     }```

1. > How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

     * If you add multiple conditions, the first one is computed first. You do "if". If that is not true, then you do the next statement "if else" (can use this many times). If that is not true, you can use "else" to cover all situations left.

1. > What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

     * repl.it & node
     * I'd definitely use repl.it first before I run it in the Terminal.

1. > What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

     * I have a few problems to still work on in functions.js. I'm going to ask for help.
     * Edit: RESOLVED!
